``simplefwk-utilitytools`` contains two helper tools that abstract low-level details of ROOT's I/O infrastructure. [ROOT][] is a C++ library developed and used primarily by the High Energy Physics community. It is versatile enough to be useful in many applications dealing with a large amount of data to analyze. In particular, ROOT has its own I/O system that allows to persistify objects (in the Object-Oriented sense) on disk.
